# Project 26 - Marble Maze

Days 85-87 of 100 Days Of Swift

https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100

## Topics

Day 85: fatalError(), SKAction, categoryBitMask, collisionBitMask, and contactTestBitMask.

Day 86: Reading the accelerometer using Core Motion and combining bitmasks using |, CMMotionManager, and SKAction sequences.

## Challenges

Day 87:

1. Rewrite the loadLevel() method so that it's made up of multiple smaller methods. This will make your code easier to read and easier to maintain, or at least it should do if you do a good job!
2. When the player finally makes it to the finish marker, nothing happens. What should happen? Well, that's down to you now. You could easily design several new levels and have them progress through.
3. Add a new block type, such as a teleport that moves the player from one teleport point to the other. Add a new letter type in loadLevel(), add another collision type to our enum, then see what you can do.
